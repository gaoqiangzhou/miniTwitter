# miniTwitter


The goal of our project minitwitter is to build a web-based application for the people who use social media every day. There are five types of users in our project (Super-user, corporate-user, trendy-user, ordinary-user and surfer). This application will provide rational and interactive interfaces for each type of user to achieve the goal of a messaging system!
